deep-learning introduction
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and extract patterns from data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, allowing them to process complex information and solve intricate problems.
types of layers in deep learning:
1.input layer:
it accepts only the raw data from the user to the machine


2.hidden layer:
it performs computation in the hidden layer which is process the data.



3.output layer:
provide the final output and prediction pn classification.


activation function in deep learning:
1.RelU: rectified linear unit
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradient of the data and which is simply used to speed during the training of the data.

2.sigmold: map the values binary(0 and 1).

3.softmax: cover the raw data into (score) convert into the probability in the given data.

back propagation and optimisation:
in this propagation step we use some of the example MSE(means standard error),cross entropy stop: which optimises the data.
